# AdamWineImplementation
Basic Numpy Implementation of Adam algorithm on Wine Dataset.

Hello everyone, 

since I am new to ML and AI, I've decided to share the results of my effort that, systematically,
grow with respect to complexity and completeness. For now, I am trying to avoid the use of frameworks in order to 
learn the basic algorithms underlying "intelligent" programs. Feel free to add constructive critiques

ADAM WINE CLASSIFIER
This program extrapolates data from the Wine Dataset (link below)
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality
and tries to predict the quality of the wine from a finite number of parameters
Up to now (26-02-2018),the program is not complete, as it is flawed by a serious Traceback
which I am not able to resolve  - See Issue thread
---> If you have suggestions on the cause, please notify me
